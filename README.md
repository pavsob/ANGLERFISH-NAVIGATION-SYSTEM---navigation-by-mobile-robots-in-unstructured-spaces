# CREATIVE-AUTONOMOUS-NAVIGATION-BY-MOBILE-ROBOTS-IN-UNSTRUCTURED-SPACES
Dissertation Project - University of St Andrews
To get to know details about the developed method, read chapter 2.5 in the dissertation document.

The goal of mobile robotics is to navigate robots in the environment without colliding with obstacles. Numerous methods deal with tackling this task where one of them is the Potential field approach. However, this method is prone to the Local Minima problem; therefore is not able to solve obstacles of high difficulty, such as c-shape obstacles.

This dissertation project developed a novel approach called the Reverse anglerfish method for mobile robot navigation to plan a safe and efficient complete route to the goal. This method also introduced a new concept of the Progress field. It tackles the problem of the local minima without collisions using the line of least resistance. It is able to solve obstacles of different levels of difficulty. The algorithm does not require access to the global map, so it is suitable for the robot moving in an unknown environment where the only known information is the goal coordinates beforehand. Thus, it is fully dependant on the local sensor. Its applicability is proved both in 2-D and 3-D robotâ€™s space and has the potential to be used in N-D applications as well. Furthermore, the user-friendly graphical user interface for setting the navigation parameters was developed, and the algorithm was incorporated and tested on the physical robot.
